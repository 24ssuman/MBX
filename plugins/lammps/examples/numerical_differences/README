For the python script to work, the LAMMPS python plugin must be installed
To do so, long story short:
1. Compile the shared libraries of MBX (--enable-shared)
2. Compile the shared libraries of LAMMPS (mode=shared when "making")
3. If there are complaints about not finding some libraries, make sure they are in LD_LIBRARY_PATH

After that, it should work.
